# Exercise: Lorem Ipsum Gem

Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text used to show how a block of text would look like on something without needing content. It is usually a random combination of words that have no meaning. For this exercise, create a ruby gem that will generate a simple version of Lorem ipsum. Refer to this [guide](https://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/) for an idea of the structure of gems. 

The basic requirements are the minimum needed to do but feel free to improve your code with the challenges.

## Basic Requirements

Create a method that will take in a number and return a string with random words equal to the number passed. You can use a list of any words to generate

Example list:

```ruby
["Lorem", "ipsum", "dolor", "sit", "amet", "consectetur", "adipiscing", "elit"]
```

Let’s say we want 20 words. An example output can look like this:

```ruby
"Sit dolor elit sit sit sit elit dolor amet ipsum amet ipsum dolor Lorem Lorem adipiscing sit elit consectetur adipiscing."
```

## Challenge: Dynamic List

Allow user to change the words used instead of a static list of words

## Challenge: Multiple sentences

Create a separate method that will take in a number and return generated sentences equal to that number.  It’s up to you how long the sentences should be.  Apply proper punctuation and capitalization.

## Challenge: Multiple paragraphs

Create another method that will take in a number and return generated paragraphs equal to that number.
